Bug Report: Centiwize Energy ROI Calculator

CRITICAL: All JavaScript Functions Are Broken (Scoping Issue)
The #1 issue is that every function referenced by onclick attributes in the HTML is defined inside a DOMContentLoaded event listener callback. This means they are scoped to that callback and not accessible from the global scope. Since inline onclick=”” handlers execute in the global scope, every single button on the page throws “ReferenceError: [functionName] is not defined.”

Affected functions (ALL of them):
lookupAddress, calculateROI, openAuthModal, closeAuthModal, switchAuthTab, handleLogin, handleRegister, handleForgotPassword, hideDashboard, saveProfile, applyWozData, switchEnergyMethod, addMonthEntry, saveCalculation, sendEmailReport, contactWhatsApp, toggleCollapsible

Fix: Either move all function definitions to the global scope (outside DOMContentLoaded), or replace all inline onclick attributes with addEventListener calls inside the DOMContentLoaded callback. The second approach is the cleaner, modern pattern.

This one bug makes the entire application non-functional:
Login/Sign Up buttons don’t open the auth modal
- Lookup button doesn’t fetch address data
- Energy method tabs (Simple Monthly / Annual Statement / Detailed Monthly) don’t switch
- Additional Details section can’t be expanded/collapsed
- “Calculate My Savings” button does nothing
- Solar Panels checkbox doesn’t show solar options panel
- “Add Another Month” button in detailed monthly doesn’t work
- Save, Email Report, and WhatsApp buttons are all broken
MEDIUM: Input Validation Issues
Floor Area accepts negative numbers: The #squareMeters input has min=”20” and max=”500” HTML attributes, but there is no JavaScript validation preventing negative values like -50 from being submitted. The HTML min attribute only marks the field as invalid on native form validation, but since there is no form element and submission is via JS, this does not help.
Total Volume has no min/max: The #volume input has no min or max attributes at all, accepting any value including negatives.
House Number field accepts non-numeric text: #houseNumber is type=”text” with no pattern validation. It accepts entries like “abc” which are not valid house numbers. Consider inputmode=”numeric” or a pattern.
Postal Code has no format validation: #postalCodeLookup has maxLength=7 but no pattern attribute for Dutch postal code format (4 digits + space + 2 letters, e.g., 1012 AB). Consider adding pattern=”[0-9]{4}\s?[a-zA-Z]{2}”.
No required fields: None of the “Get Your Report” form fields (#userEmail, #userPhone, #userName) have required attribute, despite “Email Address” seeming essential for receiving the report.
No form element: The page has zero form elements, meaning native HTML validation never triggers and keyboard submission (Enter key) does not work.
MEDIUM: Solar Options Panel Never Shows
When checking the “Solar Panels” checkbox (#imp-solar), the #solar-options div (which contains a #solarOffset input) remains hidden (display: none). There should be a change event listener that toggles this panel, but it is trapped inside the broken DOMContentLoaded scope.

MEDIUM: Duplicate HTML ID
There are two elements with id=”userName”:
A span element in the user header/dropdown section
- An input element in the “Get Your Report” section
Duplicate IDs are invalid HTML and cause document.getElementById(“userName”) to return only the first match, potentially breaking form data collection.
MEDIUM: Redundant Postal Code Fields
There are two separate postal code inputs:
#postalCodeLookup in the BAG Register lookup section (visible)
- #postalCode hidden in the “Additional Details” collapsible section
These have inconsistent text-transform CSS (uppercase vs none). The second one is redundant if the lookup already captures the postal code. Consider syncing them or removing the duplicate.
MINOR: UI/UX Issues
Placeholder text inconsistency with text-transform uppercase: The #postalCodeLookup input has CSS text-transform: uppercase, which also affects the placeholder text, turning “e.g., 1012 AB” into “E.G., 1012 AB”. Fix: use input::placeholder { text-transform: none; } or use an already-uppercase placeholder.
No semantic footer element: The footer uses div class=”footer” instead of a semantic footer HTML element. This hurts accessibility and SEO.
Missing meta description: The page has no meta name=”description” tag. Important for SEO.
Minimal responsive design: Only one media query (max-width: 600px) that adjusts form-row grid to single column. The layout does not adapt well for tablet-sized screens (600-1024px).
“Additional Details” collapsible gives no visual feedback: Users cannot easily tell the section is expandable. The “+” indicator is a CSS pseudo-element but it is small. Consider a more obvious expand/collapse icon or animation hint.
No loading states or error feedback: When buttons are clicked (even if they worked), there is no loading spinner or visual feedback to indicate processing.
Summary: Priority Order for Fixes
1. Fix the function scoping issue - move functions to global scope or use addEventListener instead of inline onclick (this alone fixes about 80% of the issues)
2. Add proper input validation (min/max enforcement, patterns, required fields)
3. Fix duplicate userName ID
4. Remove redundant postal code field or sync them
5. Fix the placeholder text-transform issue
6. Add semantic HTML (footer, form elements)
7. Add meta description
8. Improve responsive design
